# RustOS
This is an operating system for a Raspberry Pi written in Rust based on the 
Georgia Tech class CS-3210, which was itself based on the Stanford class 
CS140e. I originally started working on the CS140e version of the class then 
moved all my code into this repository and updated everything to work with the 
changes made by the Georgia Tech Staff/TAs. The purpose of this was to both learn 
the Rust language and to better understand low level programming concepts.

## Setup and Build
Setup and build are done according to instructions at https://tc.gts3.org/cs3210/2020/spring/lab/tools.html
